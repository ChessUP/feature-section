## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Grid Layout
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I focused on using more relative units (em) than fixed units (px), to try to make the project more adaptable to different types of screens.
